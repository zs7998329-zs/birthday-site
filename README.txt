Birthday Wish - Cute Theme (Netlify-ready)

How to personalize:
1. Replace assets/person.jpg with the person's photo (use same filename).
2. Optionally replace assets/happy-music.mp3 with your music file.
3. Edit index.html to change the displayed name in <span id="personName">Ayesha</span>.

How to deploy:
- Zip and drag-drop to Netlify (https://app.netlify.com/drop) OR push to GitHub and connect Netlify to the repo.

Notes:
- assets/ is intentionally empty for you to add your own files.
- If you want one unique link per person, create subfolders per person or ask me to add a generator script.
